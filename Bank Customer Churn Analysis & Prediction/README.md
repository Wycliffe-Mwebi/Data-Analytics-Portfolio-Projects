# What is Customer Churn?
Customer Churn is used to describe customers who decide to discontinue their service for a certain time frame. Churn prediction consists of detecting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service based on how they use the service.

Businesses often have to invest substantial amounts attracting new clients, so every time a client leaves it represents a significant investment lost. Both time and effort then need to be channelled into replacing them. Being able to predict when a client is likely to leave and offer them incentives to stay can offer huge savings to a business.

# Churn prediction analysis and prediction
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn rate for a Bank with Machine Learning. These predictions allow to set up a targeted strategy for customer retention.
