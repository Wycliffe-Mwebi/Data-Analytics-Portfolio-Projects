# Cryptocurrency Market Analysis
In this project, we will analyze data from Yahoo Finance of three popular cryptocurrencies to date.

We will use Pandas to extract and analyze the information, visualize it, and analyze risks based on it's performance history.

Here are questions we will try to answer:
1. What was the change of price over time?
2. What was the daily return on average of a stock?
3. What was the moving average of various stock?
4. What is the correlation between daily returns of different stock?
5. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a stock?
6. How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
