    "# How does volatility impact returns - part 2\n",
    "In part 1 of \"How does volatility impact returns?\", we looked at scenarios where the mean return was the same, but volatility (standard deviation) was different. The conclusions were that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Volatility does not have an impact on expected returns\n",
    "- But volatility does impact the probability of reaching various financial goals\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the real world, lower volatility often results in lower average returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"When volatility increases, risk increases and returns decrease. Risk is represented by the dispersion of returns around the mean.\" (http://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/08/volatility.asp#ixzz4KG4pag92)\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this part 2, we'll look at whether its better to invest in higher-risk/higher average return funds, or lower-risk/lower average return funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what's the relationship between mean returns and volatility?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to empirical analysis of Vanguard's mutual funds (see vanguard_fund_analysis), here is an equation to relate mean return with expected mean standard deviation:"
